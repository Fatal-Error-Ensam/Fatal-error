# 🚨 URGENT: GitHub Pages Setup Fix

Your GitHub Pages is trying to use Jekyll instead of deploying your Next.js app. Here's how to fix it:

## 🔧 Step 1: Check Repository Settings

1. Go to: `https://github.com/AnasAmchaar/Fatal-error-website/settings/pages`

2. **Under "Source"**, make sure it's set to:
   - ✅ **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")

3. **If it shows "Deploy from a branch"**:
   - Change the dropdown to **"GitHub Actions"**
   - Save the settings

## 🔧 Step 2: Disable Jekyll (if needed)

If GitHub Pages is still using Jekyll:

1. Go to repository **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Look for any mention of Jekyll or docs folder
3. Ensure source is **"GitHub Actions"** not **"docs/"** or **"root"**

## 🔧 Step 3: Clear Any Jekyll Files

If you have any of these files, **delete them**:
- `_config.yml`
- `docs/` folder
- Any files starting with `_` (except `_next/` from build)

## 🔧 Step 4: Verify Workflow

1. Push these new workflow files
2. Go to **Actions** tab
3. Run the **"Deploy Next.js to GitHub Pages"** workflow
4. Check the logs - should NOT mention Jekyll

## 🔧 Step 5: Force Rebuild

If still having issues:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click **"Deploy Next.js to GitHub Pages"**
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Select **main** branch
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

## ✅ Expected Result

After fixing:
- ❌ No Jekyll processing
- ✅ Direct deployment of Next.js static files
- ✅ Site shows Fatal Error homepage
- ✅ URL works: `https://anasamchaar.github.io/Fatal-error-website/`

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

1. **Delete** the repository's Pages deployment
2. **Re-enable** GitHub Pages with "GitHub Actions" source
3. **Re-run** the workflow

The key issue is that GitHub Pages **must use "GitHub Actions"** as the source, not "Deploy from a branch" which triggers Jekyll.
